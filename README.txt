THE SOLARUS CLASSIC PACK

Inside is a pack of assets for use in the Solarus Engine in the 8-bit style, 
specifically the NES, the Game Boy, and the Game Boy Colour.

Multiple branches of the git exist: Colour indicates that the sprites have been 
pre-coloured in a psuedo Game Boy Color style. Gameboy indicated that the sprites 
have been pre-coloured in a Game Boy style. The master branch is the uncoloured
version.

TO RECOLOUR:

To get the most out of this pack, you'll have to recolour the sprites and tiles.
The easiest way to do that is to open it up in the Gimp image editing program,
and use the "Color Exchange" tool in Colors>Map>Color Exchange. Simply use the
sample palette in the file as the samples to exchange from and two.

FOR AN AUTHENTIC LOOK:

For an authentic GBC look, make sure to use no more than 4 colours in any 8x8
sprite (including transparency). For an NES look, use no more than a few animated
sprites per screen, and no more than eight colours per screen. For a Gameboy look,
simply use the Gameboy palette on the far left side of the sample palette, using
either gray or the lightest green for your white and the darkest green for your
black. For an NES resolution, have your quest size set to 256x240. For the GB
and GBC, set it to 160x144.

TO HAVE FUN:

I ain't stopping you.
